Five lanes of Illumina HiSeq sequencing will be performed on each of the tumour samples and four lanes for each of the constitutional DNA. Sequencing data will mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome and analysis will be performed to characterize the spectrum of somatic variation present in these samples including single base pair mutations%2C insertions%2C deletions as well as larger structural variants and genomic rearrangements. ,2238,MDS Whole Genomes,Homo_sapiens (CGP_GRCh37.NCBI.allchr_MT),,Myelodysplastic syndrome whole genomes,,

Conventional studies in yeast and human cells have shown coordination between gene expression and cell-cycle. However such a study for mouse ES cells (mES) and their differentiation has not been performed at a single cell level. In this study%2C we obtain pure mES cells from different cell cycle stages using FACS and apply single cell RNA-sequencing using the Fluidigm C1 system. This work will decipher and unravel the transcriptional patterns that  coordinated with cell cycle progression at a single cell level.  ,2893,Single cell gene expression patterns across different cell cycle stages in mouse embryonic cells,Mus_musculus (NCBIm37),,Single cell gene expression patterns across different cell cycle stages in mouse embryonic cells,3,
