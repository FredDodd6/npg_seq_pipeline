Many of the genetic changes are non-random and recurrent%2C probably because they provide a selective growth advantage to the undifferentiated cells. Some are shared by embryonal carcinoma cells%2C the malignant counterparts of ES cells. The origins of these growth advantages are poorly understood%2C but may come from altered cell cycle dynamics%2C resistance to apoptosis or altered patterns of differentiation. Less is known about the nature and consequences of epigenetic changes%2C but it is likely that these similarly affect hPSC behaviour%3B e.g.%2C enhanced expression of DLK1%2C an imprinted gene%2C is associated with altered hPSC growth (Enver et al 2005). Inevitably%2C these genetic and epigenetic changes will impact on our ability to use hPSC for regenerative medicine%2C either because malignant transformation of the undifferentiated cells or their differentiated derivatives to be used for transplantation compromises safety%2C or because they impede the function of those differentiated derivatives%2C or because they affect the efficiency with which the undifferentiated cells can be expanded and differentiated into desired cell types. Focusing initially upon the existing clinical grade hESC lines%2C later moving to iPSC%2C we will Consolidate and extend knowledge of the rate%2C type and functional impact of the genetic variations that occur during hPSC culture. We will use whole genome and exome sequencing as well as SNP arrays%2C together with clonal analysis and other cytogenetics techniques. Common changes will be compared with those found in the normal human population%2C at low frequency in the original cell population or observed during iPSC generation in the HIPSCI project currently based at the WTSI. These studies will provide a better understanding of the range of genetic changes that occur in hPSC beyond the CNVs already identified. In conjunction with cancer genome resources and expertise at WTSI%2C bioinformatic analyses of these hPSC data will allow us to assess potential impact on hPSC behaviour pertinent to applications in regenerative medicine%2C notably the likelihood that specific changes arising in undifferentiated PSC cultures may be associated with potential malignant transformation of differentiated progeny.
