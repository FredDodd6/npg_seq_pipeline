GCTGTTCA-GAGAGTAG	19	28812271	BEED0001b_ds0001	The Bee Genomic Evidence of Novel Environmental Signatures: BEE-GEnES project (Nanoseq): The aim of the project is to determine whether exposure of honey bees to environmental compounds leads to DNA mutations through sequencing.  Bees were dosed with a panel of 7 compounds (Azoxystobin, Chlorothalnil, Clothianidin, Lambda cyhalothrin, Fluvalinate, Prochoraz or Dimethoate). Dosing was carried out by applying the compound (diluted in either Acetone or Triton-X-100) to the thorax of the bee. Un-dosed bees were also collected along with vehicle controls.
