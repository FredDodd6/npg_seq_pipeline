Using an in vitro differentiation protocol%2C which is well established in our lab%2C we will polarize na%C3%AFve T cells purified from the spleens of these mice to both Th1 and Th2 subtypes. Throughout these differentiation processes%2C we will sample cells at 5 time points (0.5h%2C 10h%2C 24h%2C 48h%2C 72h). We will carry out single cell sequencing of 96 cells at a time with the Fluidigm C1 instrument as well as traditional bulk mRNA sequencing. With two mouse strains%2C two differentiation pathways and 5 time points%2C we will have 20 single cell chips (20 times 96 cells and RNA-seq libraries) and 20 bulk mRNA samples. %0A%0AThis data will answer several questions crucial for understanding differentiation and function of these cell types%3A%0A1) Are there any intermediate cell types between na%C3%AFve and differentiated cells%3F What is the proportion of cell types in the population and how does it change over time%3F Differentiation may be a gradual process where all cells change from one state to another state via one or more intermediate states. Alternatively%2C differentiation may be a binary process where number of differentiated cells increases with time. It can also be combination of the above. Using single cell sequencing we can check if there are intermediate cell types in the differentiation process and look into dynamics of differentiation.%0A2) Is activation of T cells linked to differentiation%3F Activation of the T cell receptor is common to the differentiation of all T helper subtypes. It is debated whether T cells get activated first and then differentiation proceeds or these processes happen directly in parallel. We will look into 0.5h time point of differentiation and compare Th1 and Th2 cells to find out whether there are already detectable differences at this point.%0A3) Are cytokines monoallelically expressed%3F The hybrid mice provided by the Odom lab will allow us to study differences in expression between alleles. Previous papers claim that the T cell cytokines IL-2%2C Il-4%2C Il-5 and IL-13 are monoallelically expressed. Using whole transcriptome data and a large set of cells%2C we want to check whether we can confirm this finding%2C or whether this is an artifact of stochastic gene expression.
